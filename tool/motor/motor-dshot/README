This is a simple implementation of the DSHOT protocol to control ESCs
via the GPIO pins of a Raspberry Pi.  It was developed and used on
Raspberry Pi Zero 2, but should work on any Raspberry Pi 3 and newer.

It uses busy wait and 'clock_gettime' for timing and handles DSHOT 150
protocol well. It is running on standard Raspbian OS, no RT extension is
required. However, it may help if you use some hacks from
https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=245561&sid=d3b2f6139ccf00a88aa7a98db2aed7f3
to reduce interrupts on a specific core.

There is a more sophisticated dshot 
implementation with SMI interface and less CPU consumption at
https://github.com/Marian-Vittek/raspberry-pi-dshot-smi .

This code is inspired by
https://github.com/dmrlawson/raspberrypi-dshot. Compared to the
original, this version differs in two points:

- It uses "clock_gettime" instead of an empty loop.
- It allows multiple frames to be sent to multiple pins at once.

To compile and run a simple test that spins 4 motors connected to GPIO
16, 19, 20 and 21, type

    	   make test
	   sudo chrt -f 99 ./test 16 19 20 21

If it does not run, you may need to edit 'motor-dshot.c' and adjust
DSHOT_BIT_ns and/or DSHOT_T0H_ns macro.
